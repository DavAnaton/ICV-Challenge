# ICV Challenge

[Live demo](https://icv-challenge.herokuapp.com)

Before I worked there, ICV sent me a challenge that I had to solve.
You can find the full assigment in ```Docs/Angular-exercise.docx``` but the main idea was to create a web app that can find a shortest path on a board.
## Implementation

I really liked this assignment and went a little overboard.
I added 2 functionalities that were not mentionned: 
 - I added a saved maze that can show how the algorithm works
 - I added the ability to toggle diagonal moves
 
Both these functionalities only appear after you click ```Advanced mode```

## Tutorial

  - First, click on ```Start``` to select the starting tile on the board
  - Then, click ```End``` to select the ending tile
  - You can click anywhere on the board to create a maze between `Start` and `End`.
  - Finally, click `Go` to enjoy!

## Solution
This is what my solution looks like:
