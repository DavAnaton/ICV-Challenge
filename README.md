# ICV Challenge
Before I worked there, ICV sent me a challenge that I had to solve.
You can find the full assigment in ```Docs/Angular-exercise.docx``` but the main idea was to create a web app that can find a shortest path on a board.
## Implementation
I really liked this assignment and went a little overboard.
I added 2 functionalities that were not mentionned: 
 - I added a saved maze that can show how the algorithm works
 - I added the ability to toggle diagonal moves
 
Both these functionalities only appear after you click `Advanced mode`

## Solution
This is what my solution looks like:

And you can try it at [this address](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavAnaton/ICV-Challenge/master/Submission/index.html) (The second page doesn't work because of the interpreter I used to make it online. If you want to see it in action, you'll have to download it, sorry :) )
